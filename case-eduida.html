            <h2><span>The platform</span> by and for language students</h2>
            <p>Eduida <a href="http://www.eduida.es">www.eduida.es</a> is a platform to practise English for free and in an appealing way.
                The idea came while I was studying languages from experiencing firsthand the difficulty of finding any free tool to practise that fit the current UX quality standard. Besides, not only is it a gift for the community but also a good laboratory for us to test and put in practice the new knowledge we acquire from investigation.</p>
            <p> This project was carried out in collaboration with Álvaro Belmonte who is in charge of development. However, I, as a product owner and designer, have run all strategic planning, content creation and provision of end-to-end UX solutions. That ranges from gathering inputs to <b>achieving the following figures</b>.</p>

                <h4>Listening & Research</h4>
                <p>By the time I studied French in 2020, I found it <b>difficult to find free language-learning tools with a good user experience</b>. I often found myself frustrated with clunky interfaces from the early 2000s, <b>poorly designed lessons</b> and even <b>useless exercices</b>. Talking and <span><b>deepening with my classmates</b></span> I realized we shared the same frustrations. However I also noticed some difference that made me aware of the different needs the target audience have. Hence, I decided to design my own language-learning tool with all the information I gathered from the conversation with my peers. </p>
                <p> 
                Next, I share the most relatable descriptions I got as a Personas deliverable and a chart with brief version of the competitors analysis I did regarding features. </p>

            <h3>Think</h3>
            <p>Once I knew what people needed and how the market was divided, it was high time to kick off the challenge. I had to come up with a recognisable brand and product which were also helpful for our target audience. To get to that point, I highlighted the main points of both brand and product manifesto:</p>
            <div id="manifesto">
                <p>We need to be <strong>easy to access</strong></p>
                <p>We need to be <strong>easy to use</strong></p>
                <p>We need to be <strong>affordable</strong></p>
                <p>We need to be <strong>appealing to use</strong></p>
                <p>We need to be <strong>sincere</strong></p>
                <p>We need to be <strong>close and friendly</strong></p>
            </div>
            <p>Putting this manifesto to work turned into a new brand concept: Eduida which shortens from Educación Divertida (Fun Education in Spanish)  and also is easy to remember since phonetically sounds alike. </p>
            <p>
                For the imagotype or symbol I mix different concepts. the E from eduida, a shelf of books and a puzzle, since it pretends to be a place where books are like games and content is gamified.

                        Like in most of the famous design systems, space was set to grow over a 4px base. Any multiple of 4 would be ok to be used but ideally the ratio set was (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 60, 72) By that we assured elements to ensemble together like LEGO bricks.

                        Icons can be found all along the product and on social media posts as well. Because of that there is a need for a broad icon spectrum that allows icons to be in positive and negative. In addition icons should be stroke icons but also filled icons to ensure the best of the uses.

So let’s see the hot topics I knew I had to cover:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A hub for selecting <b>what to practice</b>: verbs, vocabulary, grammar...</li>
                    <li>A hub for selecting <b>how to practice</b>. If with one type of exercise or another</li>
                    <li>A schoolish section to <b>learn the theory</b> of the exercises</li>
                    <li>An appealing landing page to <b>lead people to act</b></li>
                    <li>An easy access to and from social media so that people were easly <b>engaged</b></li>
                    <li>A <b>free no register trial</b> so that people could have a look to how this is before registering.</li>

                <p>By using Hotjar, we had real data on user usage and have been able to <b>locate and correct important pain points</b>  affecing usabilty. As an example, I show next how we solved 3 pain points just inside the sign up and log in process.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As per reccordings not seeing password was a problem for some users</li>
                    <li>As per reccordings account creation message was not obvious and people struggled trying to sign up several times</li>
                    <li>Thanks to reccordings I saw that the link of the log in button must have been detached at some point
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>All these issues meant a hole in our system. I wonder though how it is possible only one person wrote us saying he could not log in after registration. </p>

                <p>I am far from mastering analytics but It was useful for me to check how changes from Hotjar ingsights performed. In the next image I show a generic view comparing a period before any change was done to a period where all or most of the changes  were done. It is true that by that time I did an extra effort with a social media content strategy but still, figueres are what they are. </p>
