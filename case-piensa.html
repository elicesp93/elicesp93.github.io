            <h2><span>Designing</span> the future OF utilities</h2>
            <p>The world is going on demand. Everything we used to own is now getting acquired via subscription. A very attractive business model where more and more players come to get their share of the pie. With everything turned into a utility, you can tell the utilities market has become a low-margins competition where <b>consumer acquisition feels like a headache</b>.</p>
            <p> At the same time, <b>consumers feel overwhelmed</b> with so many options to choose among while they ask for cheaper prices, easier ways to get what they want, no permanence, no hiding clauses and convenient and personalised services from their utility provider.</p>
            <p>As a relief for both, PIENSA emerges with a disruptive solution for both sides where companies can keep their margins low by <b>reducing acquisition costs</b> and users can access the offers that best fit them whilst <b>not only saving money but earning it</b>.</p>

            <h3>Think</h3>
            <span>Listening & Research</span>
            <p>The first step in Lean UX is thinking.  Here we need to understand the background and motivations of our users as well as the market fit. In this case there are two types of users. Businesses and above all, consumers.</p>
            <span>Early research</span>
            <p>We could say much of the primary research for this project was already completed. The founders of PIENSA had extensive experience in the sector, engaging in regular conversations with customers and partner companies. According to their insights, the platform would meet the needs of both groups. Nonetheless, we conducted a thorough review of all the references provided by the founders. Unfortunatelly, I cannot disclosure it here.</p>

            <p>We had some references to use as inspiration. Despite we studied all of them, we focused on the 3 main ones, which were Amazon, Glovo and Wallapop. This is a summary of the key points we got from our research.</p>
            <p>When synthsising our findings, we realised we could categorise in <b>3 acts the in-app UX</b> of these 3 references. Before the sale, during selling and after sale.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Before the sale</b> they want users to feel welcomed and easily find what they look for or even what they may like.</li>
                <li><b>During the sale</b> they want users to feel confident and empowered with their purchase.</li>
                <li><b>After the sale</b> they want users to feel satisfied and predisposed to come back.</li>

                <h4>First approach</h4>
                <p>
                    Piensa founders had a clear vision of th flow model in their mind. It had to be super simple, and super easy. They thought of having only 3 flows:
                           </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask for information.</li>
                    <li>Acquire.</li>
                    <li>Become a seller.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The concept seemed sound, with the entire process guided by a wizard to minimize friction. However, when they reviewed the initial wireframes, they realized that their idea needed to be more intricate. Both usability and aesthetics had to be enhanced.

                <div>
                    <p>After the disappointment of the initial approach, everything was revisited. Merely having a vision was not sufficient for designing a system intended to revolutionize the entire utilities market. We had to establish clear concepts and develop an architecture and usability model that could withstand the test of time and scalability</p>

            <div class="piensa-ds-container">
                <p>The business was in a rush to kick off. Due to this urgency, our design team had to blend the need for a multimedia graphic universe with the product creation process. Consequently, we launched the first version of the design system with its foundational elements and the few components necessary for the initial stage. Yet, some were refined later.</p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Content:</b> <br>
                            PIENSA's goal is to help people save money on their utility bills and earn money by contracting services and referring the platform to others. To achieve this, PIENSA must speak in an informative, transparent, and user-friendly way. There is a need to clearly and concisely explain the features and benefits, as well as how users can take advantage of them.
                            <br><br>
                            The content should be written in a way that is easy to understand, without any unnecessary jargon or technical language. Users should feel like they can trust the information presented, and that they are getting a fair deal. It's important to avoid any harmful or misleading messages, and to be upfront about any potential drawbacks or limitations of the platform.
                            <br><br>
                            In terms of tone, the content should be friendly, approachable, and helpful. Users should feel like they are being spoken to by a trusted advisor who has their best interests at heart. By adopting this content style, PIENSA can establish itself as a reliable and trustworthy platform that users can depend on to help them save money and earn rewards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Color:</b> <br>
                            The colour scheme for this project needs to be broad and include all the sub-brands colors and identifications. Also a dark profile was needed to appeal the more techie community that could be interested. Besides, some combiantions for background and multimedia messages had to be considered. As a result we got a very comple colour scheme that includes those ones for the most common and frequent stituations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Spacing:</b> <br>
                            Regarding spacing and unlike the normal design systems we opted for a 5px basis. We employ most of the multiples of 5 (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 80 and 100). By this we can adapt to the different situations on the digital and fisic world without difficulty for calculating spaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Typography:</b> <br>
                            The brand and sub-brands typography came already set by the company as the Audiowide Bold font.  So we had to adapt to it. Firstly, we used it for all headings but with time we relieved it for special occations
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Iconography:</b> <br>
                            Icons can be found all along the product and on social media posts as well. Because of that there is a need for a broad icon spectrum that allows icons to be in positive and negative. In addition icons should be stroke icons but also filled icons to ensure the best of the uses.

            <p>Throughout the PIENSA project, decisions have always been data-oriented. My team conducted extensive UX research and the marketing team has been tracking down the evolution of the project.

            <h4>Usability testing</h4>
            <span>Context</span>
            <p>The Piensa app allows users to hire utilities at the best price and generate income through an affiliate network. The MVP version is open to the public, but no prior research has been conducted since it went life. The goal is to test the app with real users to confirm its suitability for the target audience and align it with their usage patterns.</p>
            <span>Research goal</span>
            <p>The app lacked prior research since its launch, necessitating an evaluation of its real-world usability and value.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>User Satisfaction</b>: To assess users' satisfaction with the service hiring process.</li>
                <li><b>Navigation</b>: To evaluate the intuitiveness and smoothness of navigation.</li>
                <li><b>Offer Searching</b>: To measure the ease of finding offers.</li>
                <li><b>Onboarding Process</b>: To clarify the clarity of the onboarding process.</li>
                <li><b>Profile Filling</b>: To assess the appeal and ease of completing user profiles.</li>
